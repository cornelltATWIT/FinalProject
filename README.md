# FinalProject
The objective of the game is to use the paddle to redirect the ball back up and destroy all the bricks. 
You receive +1 score for every brick you break until you reach 48 which results in you winning the game. 
The paddle at the bottom of the screen is controlled by the user with the left and right arrow keys which can be both pressed and held. 
The sidewalls and the top of the map which are yellow will reflect the ball when it hits them. 
The game ends when all the bricks are destroyed or if the ball goes below the paddle. 
When the game ends you can press enter to restart the game.
